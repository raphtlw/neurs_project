The Neurs Project seeks to provide _minimalistic_ neural network and machine
learning solutions, as well as a few interesting applications for those.

## Planned Applications

 . *styliso*: an image _style isolation_ program
 . *cnmc*: the _Convolutional Neural Markov Chain_, a neural approach to
   sentence-generating Markov chains
