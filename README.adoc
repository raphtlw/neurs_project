The Neurs Project seeks to provide _minimalistic_
neural network and machine learning solutions, as well
as a few interesting applications for those.

Planned applications include:

 . *styliso*: an image _style isolation_ program
 . *cnmc*: the _Convolutional Neural Markov Chain_, an elaborate neural approach to sentence-generating Markov chains
