A demo program which demonstrates *cnmc*'s sentence generation.

It provides a console from which you may give prompts to an AI, which it will
try to give meaningful... "responses"... to.

It is possible to load text conversation logs to train the AI, as well as save
and load the state of its 'brain'.

This program is a part of the Neurs Project.
