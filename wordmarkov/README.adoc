A Markov chain library which is tailored for sentences.

This library is a part of the Neurs Project.

## Specifics

Unlike a general-purpose Markov chain, a Markov chain in WordMarkov retains
information about punctuation and whitespace.

The same two words can have multiple edges if there are instances where they
are separated differently. For example, "high priest" and "high-priest" will
both result in the tokens "high" and "priest" being linked, but there will be
two links each representing a kind of separation.

There are two special tokens, `START` and `END`, which also come into play.
The Markov chain can be walked both forwards and backwards. Whenever walking in
either direction, ideally, one of the special tokens will be reached under a
finite amount of time (words walked).
